The main file "S_matrix" is the main code, creating the matrix S for associated Legendre Polynomials. \\
the file "functions" contains all the codes useful for defining the coefficients for the polynomials. \\
TP_newton is just the implementation of the Newton method for finding roots of the Legendre polynomials of order zero.
